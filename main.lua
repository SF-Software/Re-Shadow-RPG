-- This function is called continuously and

-- usually a small value like 0.025714).

-- draw @ love
--------------------------------------------
-- love.draw is where all the drawing happens
-- (if that wasn't obvious enough already) and
-- if you call any of the love.graphics.draw 
-- outside of this function then it's not going
-- to have any effect. This function is also
-- called continuously so keep in mind that if
-- you change the font/color/mode/etc at the end
-- of the function then it will have a effect on
-- things at the beginning of the function.

-- mousepressed @ love

-- This function is called whenever a mouse

-- This function goes very well along with

--------------------------------------------
-- mousereleased @ love
--------------------------------------------
-- This function is called whenever a mouse

-- together with love.mousepressed or separate,
-- they aren't connected in any way.

-- keypressed @ love
--------------------------------------------

-- focus @ love
--------------------------------------------
-- This function is called whenever the user

-- automatically pause the game.

-- This function is called whenever the user
